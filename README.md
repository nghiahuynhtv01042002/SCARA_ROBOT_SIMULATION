Simulate a SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) robot using MATLAB.

## Project Period
September 2023 - December 2023

## Overview
This project involves simulating a SCARA robot using MATLAB. The main objectives include designing a MATLAB GUI for robot control, building a 3D model of the robot using matplotlib, and simulating forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, and path planning with the 3D model. Robot parameters are visualized through various graphs for better understanding and analysis.

## Features
- Designed a MATLAB GUI for controlling the SCARA robot.
- Built a 3D model of the SCARA robot using matplotlib.
- Simulated forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, and path planning.
- Visualized SCARA robot parameters through graphs.
